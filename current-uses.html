            <h2>Current Uses of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
            <p>Today, AI is making a significant impact in many areas. In healthcare, for example, AI helps doctors by analyzing patient data to suggest diagnoses and treatment plans. In finance, AI is used to detect fraud and automate trading processes. Retailers are employing AI for managing inventory and enhancing customer service through chatbots that can answer questions and assist shoppers. Additionally, everyday tools like virtual assistants (think Siri and Alexa) are powered by AI, helping people manage tasks and control smart devices.</p>
            <p>Here is a list of the current-uses of the Artificial Intelligence.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI):</strong> AI is being used for data analysis, machine learning models, and automation in fields such as healthcare, finance, and customer service.</li>
                <li><strong>Medical Diagnosis:</strong> AI algorithms analyze medical images (e.g., X-rays, MRIs, CT scans) to help diagnose diseases like cancer, heart conditions, and neurological disorders.</li>
                <li><strong>Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR):</strong> These technologies are enhancing customer experiences in retail, gaming, and education by creating immersive environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Drug Discovery:</strong> AI speeds up the process of discovering new drugs by predicting how different compounds will interact with biological systems.</li>
            </ul>
